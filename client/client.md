## Some information comes here as necessary

If you've just copied the repo, do:

```bash
cd client/
npm install
```
Then run expo:
```bash
npx expo start
```

All the dependencies necessary should be in package.json, so just do npm install
the first time before starting up, after that it's unnecessary.
